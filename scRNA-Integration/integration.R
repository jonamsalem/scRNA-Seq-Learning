# Here’s the corrected version:  
#   
#   **When to integrate?** When you have multiple RNA-seq datasets from different samples, treatments, etc. You can also use integration as a reference with a queried dataset. It can also be used to merge modalities.  
# 
# **We have different patients → integrate and correct for batch effects.**  
#   
#   - **Horizontal integration** – Same modality measured across different cells (e.g., RNA-seq performed on the same tissue but different patients).  
# - **Vertical integration** – Different modalities from the same group of cells (e.g., methylation data, scATAC-seq data).  
# - **Diagonal integration** – Different modalities from different cells.  
# 
# We will perform **horizontal integration** since we have the same modality but different cells.  
# 
# **What are batch effects?**  
#   Technical variations between datasets that need to be corrected for accurate comparisons.  
# 
# **Methods to correct:** Seurat v3, MNN, Harmony,etc
